                "desc": "The character has spent a significant amount of time around AGIs, to the point where socializing with an AGI is far easier. The character gains a +10 modifier on Social Skill Tests against AGIs as well as characters with the Real World Naiveté trait."

            "agi socialization": {
                "desc": "Only AGI characters may take this trait and only during character generation. The character is more adept at interpreting social cues than the average infolife. The character gains a +10 bonus on all Kinesics Tests made against transhumans. This bonus does not apply to other AGIs, uplifts, aliens, or exsurgents."

For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the character’s relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster’s should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The character’s ties to this group are also a two-way street—they will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios)."

                "desc": "The character can use and manipulate objects equally well with both hands (they do not suffer the off-hand modifier, as noted under Wielding Two or More Weapons, p. 206). If the character has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc.), this trait may be applied to a limb other than the hand. This trait may be taken multiple times for multiple limbs."

            "animal empathy": {
                "desc": "The character has an instinctive feel for handling and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds. Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests or whenever the character makes a test to influence or interact with an animal."

            "async familiarity": {
                "desc": "This character has a keen sense for the subtle behavioral clues and micro-expressions that many asyncs unconsciously adopt after their infection. As a result, they may make a Kinesics Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone. Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (–30) at best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs or spent significant time in their presence."

The character receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear or intimidation."

            "common sense": {
                "desc": "The character has an innate sense of judgment that cuts through other distractions and factors that might cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player may ask the gamemaster what choice they should make or what course of action they should take, and the gamemaster should give them solid advice based on what the character knows. Alternatively, if the character is about to make a disastrous decision, the gamemaster can use the character’s free hint and warn the player they are making a mistake."

            "digital ghost": {
                "desc": "The character has an intuitive knack for keeping their computer intrusions out of the spotlight. Once per game session, the hacker may prevent a Severe Failure or Critical Failure from downgrading their status on a hacked system (see Failing Tests, p. 257, EP)."

            "direction sense": {
                "desc": "Somehow the character always knows which way is up, north, etc., even when blinded. The character receives a +10 modifier for figuring out complex directions, reading maps, and remembering or retracing a path they have taken."
            },
            "dominant strain": {
                "desc": "This trait is only available to asyncs. The WattsMacLeod virus has a special hold on the async and aggressively resists attempts by other strains of the exsurgent virus to gain a foothold in the character. Instead of the usual –20 penalty to resist infection, the character gains a +10 bonus. Any time they must make such a test, however, they immediately suffer the effects of a derangement for 1d10 hours after the test is resolved as the Watts-MacLeod strain asserts itself. They incur no stress along with this derangement, but multiple tests to resist infection may, at the gamemaster’s discretion, incur additional derangements."
            },
            "drug exception": {
                "desc": "The character or morph has an unusual resistance to addiction for one particular biological or chemical drug (but not nanodrugs or narcoalgorithms). Addiction Tests for using that drug or resisting an addiction craving are made with a +20 modifier. Furthermore, the character halves the penalty for minor and moderate addiction to that drug, but still suffers full penalties from major addiction."
            },
            "ego plasticity": {
                "desc": "Merging forks can be stressful under the best of circumstances, but some people handle the process better than others. Per level, the character gains a +10 modifier on all Merging Tests and suffers −1 SV when merging forks."
            },
            "eidetic memory": {
                "desc": "Much like a computer, the character has perfect memory recall. They can remember anything they have sensed, often even from a single glance. This works the same as the eidetic memory implant (p. 301)."
            },
            "entrepreneur": {
                "desc": "This character is the owner or co-owner of their own small hypercorp, microcorp, or business franchise—or an active participant in an autonomist cooperative, collective, or work syndicate. This entity has its own reputation score in an appropriate social network; at the beginning of game play, this rep score equals the trait level x 20. As an owner/member, the character can call upon this rep score for favors, information, and goods, just as they would their own rep score. At the gamemster’s discretion, this venture can provide other benefits, such as enabling opportunities for smuggling, making official inquiries, or providing a cover for clandestine activities. Though a character can handle much of their management/participation in their businesses or cooperative work project via the mesh and forking, the gamemaster should ensure that the relationship is not strictly a one-way street and occasionally place obligations on the character to take care of business affairs. The gamemaster and player should work together to define the nature of the business/cooperative, such as what it focuses on, where it is based, and the other important participants. These ventures are more than just another resource for the character to call upon, as they can also be used to sew new plot seeds or create new roleplaying opportunities. The reputation score of this venture should fluctuate during game play, much like a player character’s. This may be in part due to the character’s actions, but could also result from economic or political factors outside the character’s control."
            },
            "established fork": {
                "desc": "The character begins the game with a fully instanced fork of themselves, and the player can specify if it is an alpha, beta, or delta fork; beta and delta forks will have their stats adjusted according to the rules outlined on pp. 273–274, EP. Psychosurgical alterations that differentiate the fork from the character such as personality edits, mannerisms, and gender/sexual identity (but not traits) can be defined by the player and incorporated into the fork at no cost. Any other positive or negative mental traits taken for the fork must be purchased and applied to the fork exclusively. The fork’s morph and gear must be paid for and provided by expenditure of the character’s own CP and starting credits. This trait ensures the fork is established and recognized as legal in whatever habitat the character lives in when the game starts, but there is no guarantee that the fork would be recognized as legal elsewhere or that the legality will remain current once the game is underway. This trait can be taken more than once. Players should carefully coordinate with their gamemaster to ensure a common understanding of the fork’s place in the game and how they can be utilized."

            "exceptional aptitude": {
                "desc": "As an ego trait, the character may raise the maximum for a particular chosen aptitude to 40 rather than 30 (p. 122). As a morph trait, it raises the morph aptitude maximum (p. 124) for a particular chosen aptitude by 10 (30 for flats, 35 for splicers, 40 for all others). Note that this trait just raises the maximum, it does not give the character 10 more aptitude points. This trait may only be taken by a morph or ego once."
            },
            "expert": {
                "desc": "The character is a legend in the use of one particular skill. The character may raise one learned skill over 80, to a maximum of 90, during character creation. This trait does not actually increase the skill, it just raises the maximum. This trait may only be taken once."

            "fast learner": {
                "desc": "The character improves skills and learns new ones in half the time it normally takes (see Improving Skills, p. 152)."

            "first impression": {
                "desc": "The character has a way of charming or otherwise making a good impression the first time they interact with someone. This innate social lubricant allows them to more readily deal with new contacts and slip right into new social environments. Apply a +10 modifier on social skill tests when the character is interacting with another character for the first time only."
            },
            "gold star": {
                "desc": "At some point in their past, this character did omething that permanently earned them a place in he historical annals of a particular faction. Choose ne faction. Each time the character interacts with hat faction (such as with Networking Tests) or with n NPC from this faction who knows the characterhey gain a +10 modifier. This trait is incompatble with the Black Mark trait (p. 149, EP) for the ame faction."
            },
            "hardening": {
                "desc": "Either through repeated exposure or simply due to a willful aspect of the character’s personality, the character is desensitized to one particular type of stressful experience. The player may choose one entry from the Stressful Experiences table (p. 215, EP), the Continuity Stress table (p. 233, EP), or any other specific experience that causes stress, such as specific psychosurgery procedures or Alienation Tests with a particular type of morph, with gamemaster approval. They are immune to stress from this source. This trait may be taken more than once, for hardening to different experiences. Each time it is taken, the character’s maximum Moxie score is reduced by 1. Characters may not become hardened to the merging of forks. Characters that become hardened through repeat exposure (p. 214, EP) gain this trait for free."
            },
            "heightened instinct": {
                "desc": "This trait is only available to uplifts. Though the character is fully sapient and normally socialized, the uplift process left much of their unconscious instinct intact, and they are able to synthesize a great deal of contextual information instinctively. This provides a marked advantage when dealing with confusing or tense situations, as the character’s subconscious drives their actions and responses faster than conscious decision-making. The character receives a +1 bonus to Initiative and ignores up to −10 of any modifiers for distraction when making skill tests."
            },
            "home turf": {
                "desc": "This character knows a particular habitat like the back of their hand, paw, or tentacle, having grown up there or spent years familiarizing themselves. They receive an extra point of Moxie that may only be used for tests that apply to that habitat, such as navigating the best route, bypassing airlock controls, or hacking its infrastructure."

            "hyper linguist": {
                "desc": "The character has an intuitive understanding of linguistic structures that facilitates learning new languages easily. The character requires one-third the normal amount of time to learn any language (see Improving Skills, p. 152). The character can also learn any human language in one day simply by constant immersive exposure to it. Additionally, the character receives a +10 modifier when attempting to interpret languages they don’t know."
            },
            "indenture holder": {
                "desc": "The character currently owns the indenture contract of another ego. The person subject to indenture could be anyone from a Fall infugee to a criminal working off the damages of an assault charge. The indenture itself could have been voluntarily arranged with the character, awarded by a court, or the character could have bought it through IndEX (p. 162). The terms and conditions that will end the indenture should be clearly determined as a set credit amount, levels of favors expended, or provision of specific services. It is recommended that the contractual services are reasonably likely to be completed within 6 months. Players and gamemasters should collaborate to establish the relationship the character has with the indenture and the exact skills and reputations of the NPC. Gamemasters should be very careful that this trait is not abused, and remember that, as the indenture holder, the character also has some responsibilities to the NPC. Physical harm, mental trauma, and illegal activities could negate the terms of indenture and may have serious repercussions for the character. Should the character treat their indenture well, they could become a trusted ally, but ill treatment could make them into an enemy (p. 149, EP)."

                "desc": "This character has a knack for diligence and caution in their daily living, online, and social networking interactions, reducing the amount of extraneous or sensitive information about themselves that leaks out in the public eye. Apply a −10 modifier to any Research Tests to gather information on the character or track them online (see Scanning, Tracking, and Monitoring, p. 251, EP) and any Networking Tests to ascertain the character’s networking interactions (see Keeping It Quiet, p. 288, EP)."

            "intuitive cracker": {
                "desc": "When it comes to brute-force hacking, this character has an intuitive sense for finding and deploying the right exploit tool for the job. Reduce the base timeframe for brute-force hacking (p. 257, EP) by 20% per level. Since brute-forcing a system is normally a Task Action with a 20 Action Turn timeframe, at Level 1 this timeframe is reduced to 16 Action Turns and at Level 2 it is reduced to 12 Action Turns. As usual, every 10 points of MoS on the Infosec Test may reduce this another 10%; these and other reductions (such as from Speed and extra actions; p. 96) are added together before they are applied to the timeframe."

Somehow, the character is responsible for a bulk carrier, GEV, LLOTV, scum barge, SLOTV, or standard transport. How and why this occurred— and what strings are attached—should be worked out between the player and gamemaster. The character could be an employed pilot or captain, placed in charge of a hypercorp-owned vessel. Perhaps they are borrowing a ship belonging to a criminal cartel, hyperelite dynasty, or anarchist collective. Maybe they built the ship on their own, but placed themselves permanently in the debt of an esoteric brinker group or smuggling crew to get the materials they needed. The ship may even be stolen, with a bounty out for its recapture. Whatever the circumstances, the character should occasionally be obligated to meet or avoid the needs and demands of the ships’ rightful owners, its passengers, and its crew. For example, the character may have salvaged a derelict vessel and converted it into a refugee barge during the Fall, but must now deal with the scum squatters that have effectively taken it over.

The approximate level of debt is equal to the following amount: Level 1: 20,000 credits (plus 1d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest) Level 2: 40,000 credits (plus 2d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest) Level 3: 60,000 credits (plus 3d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest) Each week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms. Hypercorp creditors may lower the character’s rep by publicly declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way or the other. If the character completely reneges on this debt, they gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits. Characters may be given the option of working off their weekly interest payment—or even their entire debt—by performing a job or other favor for the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk mission for which the organization does not want to use its own personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime syndicate.

Particularly common among corvid uplifts and some Fall survivors that lost everything, characters with this trait have a hard time giving away or disposing of things. Unless their behavior is somehow managed, they will accumulate overwhelming collections of junk. Each day, the character must make a WIL x 3 Test to keep their compulsion under control.

Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medichines (p. 308, EP). For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph’s composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metamaterials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines.

                "desc": "The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP “upgrades.” If they fail to do so, the morph’s SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods)."

This is a conscious design decision  by the manufacturer of the morph and is often used  as a means of control. By limiting access to repair  and modifications, the morph is dependent on the  manufacturer. Highly skilled technicians can work  around these barriers, but it impedes work. Standard  repair and diagnostic tools like repair spray and fixer  nanoswarms do not work on this morph, except for  manufacturer-approved brands.

Morphs reduced to a small size gain the effects of the Small Size trait (p. 95) and lose 5 points of Durability.  Durability reductions also effect Wound Threshold  and Death Rating per normal.

When presented with  triggering stimuli, the character must pass a WIL x 3  Test to resist acting out the compulsion immediately.
