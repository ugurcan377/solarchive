            "category": ["negative", "morph"],
            "desc": "Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under control-it does not ruin the character's life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix. Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing. The character obviously has a problem, and must satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until they indulge their craving. Apply a -20 modifier to all of the character's actions until they get their fix. Additionally, a character with this level of addiction suffers a penalty of -5 DUR (physical addiction) or -10 to Willpower Stress Tests (mental addiction). Major: A character with a major addiction is on the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6 hours and suffer a penalty of -10 DUR (physical addiction) or -20 to Willpower Stress Tests (mental addiction). If they fail to get their regular dosage, they suffer a -30 modifier on all actions until they do. If their life hasn't already been ruined by their obsession, it soon will be."

A much more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs (see Planned Obsolescence, p. 165, Sunward), the genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify the morph. Unless 'unlocked' by the designer through further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph's DNA, it is much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years. At the gamemaster's discretion, Medicine Tests to modify or even heal this morph may suffer modifiers ranging from -10 to -30."

For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the character's relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster's should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The character's ties to this group are also a two-way street-they will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios)."

The uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup, and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform psychosurgery on the character suffer a -10 penalty and automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. Also, backing up and resleeving are not automatic (pp. 268-271, EP) and require active management of the process. Any technician operating the ego bridge during such procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery Test or the backup/ sleeving attempt will fail."

As a result, they may make a Kinesics Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone. Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (-30) at best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs or spent significant time in their presence."

The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character's Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character's Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character's friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing this trait."

            "category": ["negative", "ego"],
            "desc": "This character is a beta fork of their original self, which for some reason is no longer alive (most likely lost during the Fall). They were created some time ago, so they have grown and overcome most of their original aptitude deficiencies. This character may not have a Moxie higher than 1 and no Active skills higher than 60, nor may they possess the Psi trait. They also have only a limited set of their original self's memories-much of their previous life is simply lost to them. They automatically receive the Edited Memories trait (p. 149, EP), without gaining the bonus CP. Beta forks are, of course, illegal in many jurisdictions, and some consider them less than human (the gamemaster may apply a Social Stigma: Beta trait in appropriate circumstances; again no bonus CP are gained)."

For some reason, no matter what they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction. Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows the character, they suffer a -10 modifier per level."

In game terms, the character is barred from having a Rep score higher than 0 in one particular reputation network. People within that network will refuse to help the character out of fear of reprisals and ruining their own reputation. The bonus for this trait is 20 CP if chosen for the rep network pertaining to the character's own starting faction, and 5 CP if chosen for any other."

            "category": ["negative", "ego"],
            "desc": "In the past, the character suffered a serious complication during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and own identity. For some reason-perhaps due to irreproducible memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance-the decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress situations can cause periods of dissociation, amnesia, and body alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of the events around them, and/ or forget certain information, memories, or skills. In this state they suffer a -10 penalty on all tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma."

Despite the best efforts of your creators and teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limitations and serious social awkwardness. Even psychosurgery is unlikely to fix you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your difficulties are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with you."

At Level 2, the character is a manager coordinating the work of 3-5 other analysts and a few dozen AIs, or a senior non-manager. For each level, the character receives a +10 on all Networking Tests within their agency. The character is actively employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of work four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week (if Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian). In some polities, the character may be able to work remotely. This trait may be a poor choice for Jovian characters, as most Jovian intel analysts are confined to the Castle, with very limited freedom of movement. Also note that characters making frequent requests for secret information not related to their job functions will draw scrutiny."

            "desc": "For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject's metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electromagnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the character to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medichines (p. 308, EP). For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph's composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metamaterials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines. This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph's Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. It also provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and electromagnetic-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions)."

The debt may be the result of a legitimate loan or the character may be a victim of extortion.

The approximate level of debt is equal to the following amount: Level 1: 20,000 credits (plus 1d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest) Level 2: 40,000 credits (plus 2d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest) Level 3: 60,000 credits (plus 3d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest) Each week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms. Hypercorp creditors may lower the character's rep by publicly declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way or the other. If the character completely reneges on this debt, they gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits. Characters may be given the option of working off their weekly interest payment-or even their entire debt-by performing a job or other favor for the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk mission for which the organization does not want to use its own personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime syndicate. The higher the debt is, the more dangerous or difficult the mission will be."

This test only needs to be made once for each language, but for each additional trauma suffered, the test must be made again, with an additional cumulative -10 modifier. If the uplift loses their language abilities, they will recover them when that particular trauma is healed. In the meantime, they can only convey and understand basic, one-word, one-syllable concepts, such as 'eat' or 'run.' At Level 2, the uplift's language centers are permanently hobbled. Their free natural Language skill at character creation is 40 + INT, and no Language skill may be raised above 60. Additionally, they must make make a Language Test to convey or comprehend particularly complex information or sentences at a -10 modifier. At the gamemaster's discretion, this may also impair other skill tests, particularly Knowledge skills when dealing with detailed data or specialist terminology. Level 2 does not incorporate Level 1 effects."

Phobic characters will go to great lengths to avoid their particular fear-they must make a WIL x 3 Test to even stay within proximity, otherwise they will flee the area. If forced into close proximity with their fear, they will suffer 1 SV per hour and take a -10 modifier to all of their actions. If they are trapped in close proximity to the source of their fear, they will suffer (1d10/2) SV per hour and take a -30 modifier to all actions. Luckily, phobias are easier to treat than other disorders. The base timeframe for psychotherapy treatment of a phobia is 20 hours. Phobia disorders may be inflicted on characters that suffer too many traumas in place of other mental disorders. Gamemasters should keep in mind, however, that phobias are easier to treat; though the possibility of taking more mental stress from the phobia may offset this. At the gamemaster's discretion, temporary phobias can be used as derangements inflicted with mental trauma (p. 209, EP). In these situations, the phobia should be linked to the particular source of trauma. For example, a character who suffers a trauma from remembering their death after vacuum exposure might pick up a derangement phobia of vacuum environments."

If they fail to do so, the morph's SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods)."

When presented with  triggering stimuli, the character must pass a WIL x 3  Test to resist acting out the compulsion immediately.
